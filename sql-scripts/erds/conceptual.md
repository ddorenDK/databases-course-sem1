## Conceptual Data Model

---

#### A Conceptual Data Model is an organized view of database concepts and their relationships. The purpose of creating a conceptual data model is to establish entities, their attributes, and relationships. In this data modeling level, there is hardly any detail available on the actual database structure. Business stakeholders and data architects typically create a conceptual data model.

- **Entity**: A real-world thing
- **Attribute**: Characteristics or properties of an entity
- **Relationship**: Dependency or association between two entities
